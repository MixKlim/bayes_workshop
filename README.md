# bayes_workshop
The material for the workshop "Bayesian Statistics: the what, the why, and the how".

The instruction will be based on the Bayes.ipynb notebook, which is written in Python 3.6, but will likely run under 3.5 as well. I use numpy 1.12.1, scipy 0.19, matplotlib 2.0.1 and emcee 2.2.1. I additionally use seaborn, because I like its plot styles, but you're free to not do that. Also astroML is used in some plots (version 0.3) and in the instruction for a bootstrap. This is not essential material for the workshop, so if you don't have that package there shouldn't be much of a problem.

All the necessary packages are in the Python 3.6 distribution of Anaconda (free: https://www.continuum.io/downloads), but can be installed with conda or pip. The additional packages are both available on pip as well.
